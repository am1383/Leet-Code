Guide programmers play many games for fun in their spare time. One of these games is the game mug. The mug game is a two-player game in the way that at the beginning we have three china mugs that are placed in a row upside down and a number of peas is under one of them. First, the first person tells the second person which cup the peas are under. Then, during a series of movements, each step changes the place of one glass with another glass, and when the movements are finished, the second person must say under which glass the peas are. Obviously, the china glass is not transparent and the second person cannot see under which glass the peas are. Now we want you to help the second person to say which glass the pea is under after doing the movements.
